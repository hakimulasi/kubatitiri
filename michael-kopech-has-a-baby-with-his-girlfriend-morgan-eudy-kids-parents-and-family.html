In July 2019, Venessa referred to Kopech as her “forever” on social media.</p><p>Well, who knew ‘forever’ would only last 11 months from the engagement date? Venessa and Kopech were married from January to June of 2021, just for five months.</p><p>Their marriage came to an end when Michael Kopech silently filed for divorce on <span>June 19, 2020, </span>right after his wife found out about her pregnancy.</p><p>We are not in the place to judge, but even his little baby couldn’t stop the athlete from being away from his wife at her most vulnerable time.</p><p>Following her breakup with Kopech, the new mother also shared ultrasound photos and photos from the set of “Riverdale.”</p><p>Morgan continued to share updates about her pregnancy on social media, referring to her son as a “lil kicker.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-kopech-personal-life-parents-and-family></span>Michael Kopech Personal Life: Parents And Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Kopech was born on <span>April 30, 1996</span>, in Mount Pleasant, Texas, to <span>Michael P.

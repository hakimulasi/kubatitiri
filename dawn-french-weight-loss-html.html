The comedian, too, has always kept everyone in the loop regarding her struggles with weight over the years.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>It has been a while since she last talked about her weight loss. And everyone seems interested to know if she is still working on losing weight.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She had a difficult time shedding pounds when she first did it in 2014, but as it was for medical reasons, she tolerated the pain. Now, though, she has no such obligations. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Dawn French Underwent Weight Loss after a Cancer Scare</h2><p>French first started losing weight in 2011, right after her split from her ex husband,&nbsp;Lenny Henry. But she kept the reasons for her weight loss a secret for a few years later.</p><p>With the void created by the lack of explanation, people started making up their own reasons. Many speculated she had a gastric band fitted, and a few others thought she was shedding pounds because of the stress from her split.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The reason turned out to be much more simple. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>French had a medical condition that needed dealing with, and it was merely a choice for her to have less suffering.</p><p>At the time, during a checkup, her doctor believed she had uterine cancer. She underwent one biopsy, and even though it came back clear, the doctor ordered a second one.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>This made her make the hard decision to have her womb removed instead. For this, she had two surgery options — invasive or keyhole. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She could have keyhole surgery, a much easier and risk-free procedure. But there was a catch — she had to lose weight to be ready for that surgery.</p><p>"The doctor told me that if I could lose some weight before the op, they would be able to do it via keyhole, and I would recover in three weeks or so," she opened up during her 30 Million Minutes tour in 2017.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"Otherwise it would be big open surgery, and three months to recover," she added. "So, I set about dropping a few stone." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Dawn French's weight loss was less miracle and more hard work and pain. [In picture: Dawn French for Good Housekeeping, February 2022]</strong> (Photo: Dawn French/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And drop weight she did, shedding seven-and-a-half stones, or 105 pounds in a really short time. For French —&nbsp;who weighed 266 pounds before losing weight —&nbsp;weight&nbsp;loss wasn't, however, a&nbsp;passion or a deep desire. Instead, it was just an obligation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"I lost seven-and-a-half stone. I could have the keyhole surgery. Great. That's all it was, practical," she said of her weight loss. And she didn't take any shortcuts, either.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"No magic wand, just tiny, joyless low-cal eating and lots more walking for weeks and weeks. It was grim," she said during the show.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Dawn French Did Not Care about Gaining Weight</h2><p>After her almost-miraculous weight loss in 2014, French started gaining pounds again. The gain was not&nbsp;bothersome, though.</p><p>While speaking on her podcast, French and Saunders, alongside Jennifer Saunders in October 2020, she revealed her thoughts on gaining weight again. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I've gone back to being an entire barrel," she quipped. "but do you know what, I'm going to be 63 this year, I don't give a [expletive], I really don't, so long as I can walk."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She did not want to be "stingy" to herself, and she never disliked her body, even when she was "very, very fat."</p><p>The comedian loathed comments implying she was not good-looking when she was heavier. "It's so patronising," she said.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In 2017, she told Loose Women she felt no different regardless of how much she weighed. "I'm still Dawn, I liked the old Dawn, I may go there again, depends how many doughnuts I decide to eat," she joked.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>French told an Australian magazine (via <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a>)&nbsp;that people were upset when she lost weight as she "betrayed the fat club by losing a lot of weight."</p><p>But, when she put on 42 pounds, she "swung back towards the fat club and everyone stopped freaking out." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, despite not caring about her weight now, she still cares about the lies being spread about weight loss. In June 2021, she <a href=# rel="follow noopener">exposed a fake diet</a> advert that used her fabricated testimonial to make the product look genuine.</p><p>In May of that same year, scammers had used her image as before and after pictures to sell their controversial ketone pills, which she called "a total rip-off."</p><p>We're not sure about doughnuts, but she is in no way going to eat lies about her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyRrLtustGepZygXayyqrPHrWSlp6Ooe6nAzKU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./foster-moreau-meet-his-girlfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Foster Moreau: Meet his Girlfriend, Bio, Wiki, Age, Career, Net Worth 2023 and More">&larr;

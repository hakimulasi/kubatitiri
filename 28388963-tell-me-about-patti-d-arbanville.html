It has come up because the star of the film has some other projects she is plugging now and a lot of the old stories about the movie are resurfacing. There will be a blind about that movie next week. While doing the research though, i saw one of my favorites in the cast list and clicked on her name to see what she is up to now. When i clicked, i had to blink a couple of times because i thought to myself that couldn't be right. She would never do that. It turns out she would. She is an actress who has literally been around forever, but never looks old. She is considered a mostly television actress and had a nice long run on a hit cable television show that ended not that long ago. She is known though for something much more important in history. I consider her to be the first "it girl." the first time that term may have been used. That is a big honor. Anyway, she has a secret that she only shared with a few people who got drunk with her back in the day in the club that will never be duplicated. She says she had sex with one of the most infamous people in history. She had so many details that no one left an encounter with her doubting her story. As far as i know she has not mentioned it to anyone in decades and my source from that club who was there every night and is still friends with her today says she never mentions it. She is afraid of the damage it might cause her career now. So, that is what makes what she is doing now, so damn interesting.</p><p>[quote][italic]patti d'arbanville and charles manson[/quote]</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 39</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 3, 2021 10:48 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Didn't Cat Stevens write a song about her?</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 2</td><td class=timestamp><span>April 24, 2021 12:12 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Patti has a 38-year-old son with Don Johnson, and she had a relationship with Cat Stevens, who wrote "Lady D'Arbanville" and "Wild World" about her.</p><p>She was also one of Antonio Lopez's girls, along with Grace Jones and Jessica Lange.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 3</td><td class=timestamp><span>April 24, 2021 12:16 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>She lived in my hometown of Sea Cliff, on the north shore of Long Island, for awhile.</p><p>She was in Modern Problems with Chevy Chase and Real Genius with Val Kilmer.</p><p>She was almost unrecognizable in The Sopranos.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 4</td><td class=timestamp><span>April 24, 2021 12:20 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I knew one of Sydney Biddle Barrows’s girls.

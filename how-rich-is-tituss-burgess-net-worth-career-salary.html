The actor’s charming charisma on the show will keep viewers hooked to their televisions.</p><p>Five teams will be charged with sculpting twenty-ton snow slabs into magnificent works of art in the new Disney+ series. These will be influenced by Pixar, Marvel, Walt Disney Animation, Walt Disney Studios, and The Muppets Studios, among others. The cast members will bring to life several Disney characters, including Moana, Coco, and The Lion King.</p><h2>The wealth of Tituss Burgess</h2><p>The host of Best in Snow, Tituss Burgess, has a $5 million fortune. The Little Mermaid, Guys and Dolls, Jersey Boys, Good Vibrations, and other Broadway productions featured the actress. In the television series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, he is best known for playing Titus Andromedon (2015).</p><p>For the same performance, Tituss was nominated for an Emmy in 2018.

In addition, Burgess was honored with two Critics Choice Television Awards for his work in a comedy series.</p><p>Additionally, he has won multiple accolades for his work in television, including the 2015 Webby and Gold Derby TV Awards.

You will get all the information related to the incident below.</p><h2><strong>How Did Luis Fernando Cevallos’ Incident Happen?</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>In a video</a>, <strong>Officer Jon Nunez of the North Bergen Police Department pulled down a 2022 Kia Stinger at 61st Street at 1:49 AM on August 4, 2021 due to excessive speeding and reckless driving</strong>. He got in touch with the driver and his passenger, who was identified as Luis Fernando Cevallos and Alexis Rodriguez respectively.</p><p>According to Alexis, they were on their first date. She blamed herself for his careless driving because she was pressed for time to get home.</p><p>Alexis was informed by Officer Nunez that it was not her fault and Luis was given three tickets for careless driving, failing to obey a flashing traffic signal and breaking the terms of a provisional license.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-scene-of-the-Incident-1-2.jpg><p>Officer Nunez cautioned Luis to drive safely to avoid a fatal collision before allowing him to go. By 2:02 AM, the traffic stop was over. <strong>Officer Nunez responded to a radio transmission made by Officer Jessica Toro at around 2:13 AM about a tractor-trailer accident.</strong></p><p>He saw the identical car that he had just stopped a short while ago as he got closer to the accident scene that took place near the Paterson Plank Road overpass on Tonnelle Avenue.</p><p>According to reports, they were traveling south on Tonnelle Avenue at a noticeably high speed when they struck a 2021 Volvo tractor-trailer that had positioned itself across all four lanes of the road for an early morning delivery to a nearby business.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gina-Pellettiere-Obituary-2.jpg alt="Luis Fernando Cevallos: What is the Reason of His Death?" width=1200 height=675 title="Luis Fernando Cevallos: What is the Reason of His Death?" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>He promptly requested a crash team to look into a deadly collision after noticing that the Kia Stinger’s occupants appeared to be dead.</strong> Officer Kevin Rodriguez searched through Alexis Rodriguez’s purse to identify her even though it was clear that the driver was Luis Fernando Cevallos.</p><p>This is because Officer Nunez had not requested Alexis’ identification during the traffic stop. Shortly after, Sergeant Schubert, Sergeant Yousef, Officers Rodriguez, Perez, Vitali and Sloan arrived on the scene. North Bergen EMS South and ALS Unit 476 also arrived at the scene. At 2:26 AM, a doctor on the site pronounced the car’s driver and passenger dead.</p><p><strong>In our previous posts, we covered the obituaries of Sarah Gelish & Joanne Epps, if you want to know how they died you can check out our below posts:</strong></p><h2><strong>What did the Truck Driver Say About the Incident?</strong></h2><p><span><strong>The truck driver admitted that he was backing into 36th Street to make a delivery at Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors’ loading dock</strong> while Officer Nunez went on to gather documents from him and obtain his story of what happened.</span></p><p>The Kia Stinger, which was headed south, slammed into his tractor-trailer as he was excessively backing in. The truck driver was eventually taken to police headquarters by Officer Vitali so that he could provide a voluntary statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gina-Pellettiere-Obituary-2.jpg><p>The deadly accident was reported to the Hudson County Medical Examiner’s Office by Sergeant Tattoli. Officer Suarez and Detective Mena arrived at the scene at about 2:45 AM to start their investigation. At 3:37 AM, Sergeant Ragland with the collision unit of the Hudson County Prosecutors arrived on the site.</p><p>At 5:35 AM, a medical examiner’s investigator arrived and at 6:10 AM, they both of the remains were removed. At 6:30 AM, the Kia Stinger was taken away and at 6:45 AM, the road was reopened. At 1:00 PM, Detective Mena and Secaucus Police Lieutenant Martin Moreda, a member of the Hudson County Regional Crash Team, arrived back at Tumino’s Towing.</p><p>By 7:00 PM, Lieutenant Moreda had established that the Kia Stinger had been moving at 124 MPH (181.784 feet per second) during the 5 seconds before to impact. The Kia Stinger was moving at 68 MPH (99.688 feet per second) at the time of the accident.</p><p>The detective finished his investigation on August 24, 2021 and came to the conclusion that the deadly collision would not have occurred if the motorist had been traveling at the posted speed limit rather than 124 MPH.</p><p>You can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> and check out our other latest posts related to these kinds of topics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgbnxzg46lrKKrXZuys7rAp5uoZZOaw6K4y6iqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./maker-of-lighters-pens-and-razors-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maker of lighters pens and razors">&larr;

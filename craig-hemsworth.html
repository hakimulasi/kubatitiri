His admirers are unaware of his superhero persona as a devoted father to three children, though.</p><p>Hemsworth is presently generating hype in advance of the release of his most recent film, Thor: Love and Thunder, in which he portrays the former king of Asgard in the title role.</p><p>Hemsworth has been wed to Spanish actress and model Elsa Pataky since December 2010. The family has three kids in total: a daughter named India Rose Hemsworth and twin sons named Sasha and Tristan.</p><h3>Chris Hemsworth Biography</h3><p>Chris was born to Craig and Leonie Hemworth in Melbourne, Australia. He was reared by his parents, along with his brothers Liam and Luke Hemsworth.</p><p>Even as a young child, acting has always been Chris’ main passion. He used to emulate whatever acting technique he saw on television, as did his brothers. Along with acting, Chris is a passionate surfer.</p><p>Shortly after graduating from Heathmont Secondary College, he received a call with an offer for a small role in a TV show. His great passion and commitment to the business have made him one of Hollywood’s finest actors.</p><p>Since he was a young child, Chris has made the decision to follow his passion for acting. He was constantly improving his talents and becoming in shape, but he wasn’t shown on camera until after he graduated from high school. He is currently the actor most in demand for leading roles in <a href=#>action movies</a>.</p><p>Chris may be seen in several of Hollywood’s most well-known movies, such as “The Avengers,” “Snow White and the Huntsman,” “Rush,” and many others.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ubd52e2943d6affa930b6205edf967966><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Best Liam Hemsworth Movies and TV Shows</span></a><p>Chris Hemsworth’s net worth was $130 million as of 2022.</p><h3>Chris Hemsworth Parents: Meet Craig Hemsworth And Leonie Hemsworth</h3><p>His parents are English tutor Leonie Hemsworth and social services counselor Craig Hemsworth. One of their sons is him.</p><p>Chris Hemsworth and Luke Hemsworth, the two older sons of his parents and both well-known actors, are younger siblings to Liam.</p><h3>Who is Chris Hemsworth’s dad?</h3><p>The father, however, was still beautiful well into his late 60s as evidenced by the Hemsworth brothers’ final Father’s Day photos.</p><p>Chris and Liam both posted images of the 66-year-old Hemsworth father wearing only his underwear while referring to him as a “champion” on their Instagram profiles.</p><p>Chris, however, revealed much than simply that picture.</p><p>Additionally, he shared vintage photos of Craig, his siblings, and their mother Leonie Hemsworth on what appeared to be a camping trip when they were all still very little.</p><p>Last but not least, the Thor star tweeted a sweet contemporary photo of the pair at what appeared to be his multi-million dollar Byron Bay home, both of them dressed in similar black suits and headgear.</p><p>The actor wrote in the message, “Happy Father’s Day you huge bloody champion!!” with a fistful of love.</p><h3>Who is Chris Hemsworth’s mother? Leone</h3><p>On Mother’s Day 2020, the actor published a picture with his mother, who was 60 at the time, shocking his fans.

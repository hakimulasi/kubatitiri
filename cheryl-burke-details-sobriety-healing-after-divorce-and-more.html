My journey with sobriety began the night of my engagement party in 2018. I had recently lost my father, who was also an alcoholic, and that time of my life was a huge turning point in so many ways.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cheryl-Burke-Pens-Essay-About-Sobriety-Soul-Searching-After-a-Public-Divorce-and-Her-Future-in-Dance-001.jpg><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>If I am being completely honest, I did not decide to quit that day because of some defining realization that if I kept drinking, I would crash and burn (although, looking back, I know that would have definitely been the case). Instead, I mainly stopped for vanity reasons, at least initially. When I returned from burying my father in Thailand, every time I had a drink, I would turn red and break out in hives, which scared me because I had never had a reaction like that before. It was like my body was rejecting the poison I so desperately wanted to use to numb. So, the night of that party, after trying just one drink, <a href=#>I decided I couldn’t do it anymore and I quit — cold turkey</a>. That’s very much my personality, I’m an all-or-nothing kind of girl. I didn’t tell anyone at first. I think I was afraid the pressure of other people knowing would lead to me self-sabotaging and my reason for quitting felt shallow. I know now that doesn’t really matter though, shallow or not, I stopped, and that vanity probably saved my life.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>My life in the four years since that night went from obsessively wedding planning, to being a newlywed in the worldwide COVID lockdowns, to just <a href=#>getting back to work and then to divorce</a>. I can honestly say I did not anticipate the way any of those events would actually play out, and nothing could have prepared me for it. While I am ultimately glad that I did it all sober, I would be lying if I acted as though it was easy.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>I think the biggest reason I drank the way that I did for all those years was to numb, and numbing can sound really appealing when you are going through any sort of hardship. Sure, I think a lot of people have a drink to “take the edge off” but for me, it was deeper than that. I was living in fear of actually feeling anything. So, these past four years have been filled with a lot of heartache, a lot of soul searching, a lot of coming to terms with my past and the way things have ended up in my present. There are definitely days when a little voice creeps into my mind wondering if things would be easier if I hadn’t quit. I mean, I <a href=#>hit some of the highest points of my life and career</a> while I was partying pretty much on a daily basis. Were things better because I was less in my head about every little detail?</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Thankfully, I have found reasons to not fall into the temptations of my occasional self-doubt — the biggest being the knowledge that I owe it to myself to live my life as fully as I can, and for me, that means a sober life. The belief in a power greater than myself consistently helps me to stay the course when things get hard and I have to <a href=#>give credit to my dog Ysabella for keeping me going</a> a lot of the time. Yep, I’m a full-blown “dog mom” and not ashamed to say it! Going through a public divorce, there have been days where I wanted to just stay in bed and hide, and the idea of numbing my emotions with a vodka soda can sound pretty appealing. But Ysabella has tons of energy and gets me outside to go for walks multiple times a day, she loves me to play with her and I honestly <a href=#>can’t imagine life without her</a> by my side 24/7.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>I’m at a point in my life right now where I don’t know exactly what my future holds. I’m going through a transition not just personally, but also in my career, which has left me living in uncertainty for the first time in over a decade. I’m trying to be OK with it instead of living in fear of the unknown. I know that dance and movement are an essential part of my life and mental health, but <a href=#>I’m ready to share these passions in new ways</a>. I got married with every intention of forever but now I’m starting over, and the word dating gives me so much anxiety that I have no idea when I’ll be read. So, for now, I am choosing to date myself. I am putting myself first for once in my life, in order to really learn to love the woman I am today, while continuing to strive to be the best version of myself that I can be. I know this will be a lifelong journey, but I am dedicated to staying curious and to taking my journey with my sobriety one day, and sometimes even one step and one hour, at a time.</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Listen to Burke’s iHeartRadio podcast, “<a href=#>Burke in the Game</a>,” everywhere you get your podcasts.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJWnxq15wa6ppJ1dmbK1rcilqmarn5e%2FqrHTsmShnZGhtq%2BzjJqdrZ2iYrGqws6rmp5lkaOxbrnOq5xo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./davina-mccall.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Davina McCall: news and photos, workout tips, and more">&larr;

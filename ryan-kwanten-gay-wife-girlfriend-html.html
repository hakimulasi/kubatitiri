He left the show in 2002 and moved to America in hopes of making it big in Hollywood.</p><p>In 2004, he landed a major role as the character Jay Robertson in Summerland. More roles would soon follow as he appeared in films like Flicka(2006) and Dead Silence(2007). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The University of Sydney alumni 2008 run is believed to be the biggest one of his career as he won the role to play a US Marine accused of raping and murdering in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Units and was cast to play Jason Stackhouse in the hit teen vampire series, True Blood in the same hearing.</p><p>His Wikipedia reveals he has acted in over 25 films and landed over 18 roles on TV.</p><h3><strong>Going Back To TV Shows After Hollywood Bound</strong></h3><p>The actor, who moved to Hollywood 16 years ago after an impressive TV career, looks forward to making it big again to the TV scenarios as he's all set to feature in a new world in Seth Larney’s ‘2067’&nbsp;in 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Although Kwanten is starring in and serving as one of the producers of&nbsp;The Oath, a crime drama and portraying the role of Steve Hammond, leader of the Ravens gang, he wants to try something new and Seth Larney's '2067' is the perfect suit for him.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, he also had the pleasure of sharing experiences with Nicolas Cage in&nbsp;Kill Chain, a thriller from Millennium Media and CineTel Films, a tale of betrayal and revenge involving crooked thieves, gangsters, cops, and an ex-mercenary.</p><p>Well, all for now, maybe Kwanten is now all focused to making it big in his TV career as he is looking forward to collaborating&nbsp;again with Sen, Seth Larney's '2067' director, next year in&nbsp;Loveland. In the TV series, he will co-star with Hugo Weaving. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So for all the old school Ryan fans, mark your calendars, he is coming soon&nbsp;with a bang in a completely different style in&nbsp;Seth Larney's '2067'.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Know More About Ryan!</strong></h3><p>Born on 28 November 1976, Ryan’s middle name is Christian. He was born to a Dutch father, Eddie, and a mother, Kris in Sydney, Australia. He has two brothers: Mitchell and Lloyd who are a musician and a doctor respectively.</p><p>Before earning a degree in commerce` from the University of Sydney, the actor/comedian attended St. Paul’s Catholic College in New South Wales. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3><strong>Famously Infamous Gay Scene In True Blood</strong></h3><p>The 41-year-old Aussie ex-pat portrays the gay character, Jason Stackhouse in True Blood. Recognizing the show’s substantial gay following, he and his co-stars begged for a gay sex scene between the characters, Jason and Alexander. The now infamous sex scene was aired on the second episode of its penultimate season.</p><p>Ryan’s brother, Lloyd is an openly gay doctor. Speaking to reporters about his brother in 2016, he said:</p><p>Lloyd was probably about 18 when he came out, and I can wholeheartedly tell you that from the day that he did, he was a changed man for the better.</p><p>The True Blood star, however, has never identified himself as a gay man. In fact, he’s been dating actress Ashley Sisino since 2013. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><strong>Girlfriend&nbsp;Ashley Restores His Faith In Love, Wife-To-Be?</strong></h2><p>Before dating Ashley, Ryan dated actress/fashion model Taylor Cole for two years between 2006 and 2008. The couple was very much invested in each other, and sources quoted that the couple was on the verge of turning into husband and wife at one point.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You May Like</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>What Is Tim Baker's Age? Family, Wife, Wedding, Job, Net Worth - Personal Life Details</a></p><p>In 2010, he was rumored to have been dating American country singer, Whitney Duncan. Neither party involved in a romance, however, declined to comment on the rumors, which led to their relationship petering out as just rumors.</p><p>His breakup with Taylor took an emotional toll on him as evidenced by his 2010 interview with USA Today in which he claimed to have focused only on his career and career alone. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Love Prevails: </strong>Ryan and his long-term girlfriend, Ashley at the premiere of The Oath at 2013&nbsp;(Photo: dailymail.com)</p><p>However, that perception seems to have changed with time as he has been in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend. The couple completed their five years of togetherness in 2018 and are still going strong in their relationship. His girlfriend seems to have renewed his faith in the institution of love and marriage.</p><p>Watching Ashley mold Ryan in an almost wife-like fashion, a question reckons: Is marriage on the horizon for the couple?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnoq6ur3nKsJinrJWjeqit2Gauop6VYrSqvsufqaKdnpl7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-im-a-finesser-a-slick-talker-tiktok-song-trending-music-by-airitout-juju-making-high-waves-268802-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Im A Finesser A Slick Talker TikTok Song?

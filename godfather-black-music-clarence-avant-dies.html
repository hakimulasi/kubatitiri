No cause of death was announced, <a href=#>Variety </a>reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#><i><b>>> Read more trending news</b></i></a></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">According to <a href=#>The Associated Press</a>, Avant died Sunday at his Los Angeles home. His family announced his death on Monday.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Through his revolutionary business leadership, Clarence became affectionately known as ‘the Black Godfather’ in the worlds of music, entertainment, politics, and sports. Clarence leaves behind a loving family and a sea of friends and associates that have changed the world and will continue to change the world for generations to come. The joy of his legacy eases the sorrow of our loss. Clarence passed away gently at home in Los Angeles on Sunday, August 13, 2023,” they said in a statement, according to <a href=#>Variety</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Avant was born in a segregated Greensboro, North Carolina, hospital in 1931. He was one of eight children and raised by a single mother. He left high school to find work, eventually managing a lounge in New Jersey. He met his mentor Joe Glaser, a manager who represented Louis Armstrong, Barbra Streisand and even Al Capone, the AP reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">He rose through the music world, becoming a manager in the 1950s and representing such singers and songwriters as Sarah Vaughn, Little Willie John and “Mission: Impossible” theme song composer Lalo Schifrin.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Decades later, he was an early patron of Black-owned radio stations in the 1970s and even took over control of Motown in the ‘90s after it was sold by founder Berry Gordy Jr.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Avant helped Michael Jackson embark on his first solo tour and helped launch the careers of Narada Michale Walden, L.A. Reid and Babyface, the <a href=#>AP</a> reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Everyone in this business has been by Clarence’s desk, if they’re smart,” mega-producer Quincy Jones had said of Avant.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Jones and Avant had become friends after missing out on a deal for Jimmy Smith. Jones was a vice president at Mercury Records and Avant was representing Smith. Mercury Records had signed Dizzy Gillespie for $100,000 and Avant tried to get about half a million for his client. Mercury didn’t sign Smith, who then went to Verve Records for that money, the <a href=#>AP </a>reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Avant was inducted into the <a href=#>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 2021, <a href=#>TMZ </a>reported. He was awarded the Ahmet Ertegun Award.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">But Avant didn’t keep his focus just on music, helping Jim Brown transition from the NFL to becoming an actor. He also produced a television special for Muhammad Ali and secured deals for Hank Aaron when he was closing in on Babe Ruth’s home run record, making sure he got the same commercial spokespersons spots that at the time were not common for Black athletes and going so far as to personally making demands of the president of Coca-Cola, the <a href=#>AP</a> reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Aaron told The Undefeated that everything he had become was “because of Clarence Avant,” the <a href=#>AP </a>reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Avant also was a player in politics, working behind the scenes raising money for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and serving as an advisor for them, as well as for Jimmy Carter and George Bush, officially or unofficially, <a href=#>Variety </a>reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">He also was an early supporter of Tom Bradley, the first Black mayor of Los Angeles, and backed civil rights leader Andrew Young in his race for Congress to represent part of Georgia, the <a href=#>AP </a>reported. They had never met before the campaign, but he offered to bring in Isaac Hayes and other stars for a benefit event held at a baseball stadium in Atlanta. Young forgot about the event until about a month later, when he started seeing signs promoting the show.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“We had about 30,000 people in the pouring down rain,” Young said, according to the <a href=#>AP</a>. “And he never sent us a bill.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Young was elected to Congress in 1971, according to his biography on Georgia State <a href=#>University’s</a> website.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Bill Withers said during Avant’s <a href=#>Hall of Fame</a> induction that, “What he’s done is a very unusual story. He puts people together, and they do what they do. How do you put together a life from knowing people? I’ve never seen him with a tool.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“My whole career has been like this,” Avant told <a href=#>Variety </a>in 2016. “People ask me, ‘how did you do all this?’ How the [expletive] do I know? I just do things. I just like to take shots.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Avent’s life was touched by tragedy in recent years, as his wife of more than 50 years was found murdered in their home 19 months ago, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported. Jacqueline Gray was shot and killed in a burglary attempt in 2021 at the age of 81, <a href=#>Variety</a> reported.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">He leaves behind his children, Alexander and Nicole, along with his son-in-law, Ted Sarandos, the CEO of Netflix, <a href=#>TMZ </a>reported.</p><p>Latest noteworthy deaths:</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph body-copyright">©2023 Cox Media Group</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKyimrultc2gZqCnlJuutbTEq2SbpJGYuG651KygnGWToa6zsc2cnGaZppa7tXnDopysZ4FqlJmAs4FphI50jqWKmaSQiW5siGekm3%2BkaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-rich-is-tituss-burgess-net-worth-career-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Rich Is Tituss Burgess Net Worth, Career, Salary">&larr;

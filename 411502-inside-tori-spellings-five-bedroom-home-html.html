The former "Beverly Hills 90210" icon has traded her life of luxury for a modest motel room and the simplicity of an RV after realizing that her five-bedroom home, a seemingly tranquil haven, concealed a dangerous secret threatening her family's health.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In a stunning reversal of fortune, Tori Spelling, once accustomed to a life of opulence and privilege, finds herself in a dramatically different living situation. The former "Beverly Hills 90210" star has taken up residence in a motel room and an RV with her five children, a far cry from the lavish upbringing she experienced in her father's multi-million dollar mansion.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Growing up as the daughter of television magnate Aaron Spelling, Spelling was immersed in a world of affluence, residing in the sprawling 56.5K-square-foot French chateau-style mansion known as "The Manor." This palatial estate, complete with 123 rooms, 27 bathrooms, and 14 bedrooms, provided the backdrop for her formative years.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial><a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12284087/Tori-Spelling-seen-staying-LA-MOTEL-five-kids-amid-Dean-McDermott-marital-strife.html>Spelling's life today</a> bears little resemblance to the glamorous existence she once knew. A little more than a month ago, photographs captured Spelling leaving a budget motel with her children.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>This motel stay comes in the wake of her ongoing divorce proceedings with Dean McDermott, her husband of 18 years, and an announcement that their marital home had been infested with mold, causing severe health issues for her family. In an unexpected twist, <a class="ae -U" href=#>Spelling</a> has traded her luxurious surroundings for the simplicity of a motel room and, later, an RV.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The actress, now 50 years old, has been seen living in a Sunseeker E450 RV in Ventura County, accompanied by her children Liam, Stella, Hattie, Finn, and Beau.

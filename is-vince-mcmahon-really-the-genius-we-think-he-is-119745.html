I give him credit where it's due but nothing Vince McMahon has done after WrestleMania has been original. He has stolen other people's ideas, dubbed it as his own, and has been riding that wave ever since.</p><br>Yes, it's very easy live off your accomplishments from the 80's. That is clearly why McMahon is making millions upon millions every year. Clearly.<p>Attitude Era=ECW Revolution imitation</p><br>This is one of the funniest claims ever. Did ECW help bring in the Attitude era? Yes, yes it did. However, you are (most likely, though I do not know you personally) one of those guys who watches ECW stuff on Youtube, watched One Night Stand, bought the Rise and Fall DVD and declares themselves an expert. ECW was a place where guys who couldn't work for the other companies could go and be different.<p>ECW was crash TV just like the Attitude era but the Attitude era did NOT feature storylines ripped off from ECW, they did not use blood and weapons every match, every night. Hell, the Attitude era didn't even develop characters like ECW did. They are NOT the same, there are similarities but they are NOT the same and ECW do not deserve anything more than a small amount of credit for ushering in Attitude. The angle that properly ushered in the Attitude era and, I would argue, turned WWE's business around was McMahon/Austin, an angle that (correct me if I'm wrong) didn't play out in ECW and had no ECW counterpart.</p><p>Steve Austin=Sandman</p><br>PMSL! To even insinuate that The Sandman had even a fraction of the talent that Stone Cold Steve Austin had is completely and utterly ridiculous in my opinion. Were the characters similar? Yes, they both drank beer, yes they both beat people up. Does that mean the Sandman and Heyman are responsible for Austin? Not at all.<p>Did the Sandman and Heyman create the cool catchphrases? No.</p><p>Did the Sandman and Heyman create the marketing machine behind Austin? No.</p><p>Did The Sandman and Heyman cut the 3:16 promo? No.</p><p>Did The Sandman and Heyman create the McMahon/Austin angle? No.</p><p>Did The Sandman and Heyman create the Stone Cold character? No. The characters both drank beer and beat people up, that's hardly copyright infringement.</p><p>Vince McMahon was involved in almost all of the things that made Austin the biggest wrestling star ever and Austin took the company onto his shoulder. To insinuate he simply copied the Sandman is ridiculous, if the Sandman's gimmick was that amazing surely he would be starring in movies and ECW would be making millions but....he's not and they're not. The Sandman and Paul Heyman are NOT responsible for Stone Cold, Stone Cold and Vince McMahon are.</p><p>DX=NWO ripoffs.</p><br>This is the only one you I will partially admit is slightly true....but not very. They were both controversial groups, that's the only REAL similarities. One was a group of sophomoric goofs and the other were edgy, cool and bad ass. They didn't participate in similar angles, they didn't use the same gimmicks. They're different. Vince McMahon was involved (albeit only lightly at the start judging by Michael's book) in the creation of this group that greatly benefited WWF's business.<p>And look at current day WWE. The product sucks. If not for the fact that he's been on cable tv so long and has built such a huge audience over the years, no one would watch. His show is trash.</p><br>Your logic is flawed. Look at Scrubs, a show who's second series averaged at 15 million viewers, it was cancelled in season 9 after averaging only 3 million. Why was it cancelled? Because it was getting old and nobody liked the new characters. If nobody liked the new characters on Raw, or the product it wouldn't still be doing ratings and it still wouldn't be still on the air after 15 years. Simply because you don't like the product and the IWC community doesn't like the product isn't necessarily to say nobody else does, I personally don't like it but the ratings speak for themselves.<p>Further, no matter how much of an audience you build up the public are not mindless idiots who'll watch any drivel and like it because they're trained to. If they were, we wouldn't see tv shows like Scrubs being cancelled after 9 or 10 years and they built up just as much, if not more, of an audience than Raw. If people didn't like it they wouldn't watch it and it wouldn't be on TV.</p><p>Also let's think about it. What does he really do now? He doesn't come up with any creative ideas. He signs these trash writers from Hollywood and when they come up with scripts, all he does is cosign those ideas and look over it for approval but that is about it. From the attitude era from this day, I will not credit him because those ideas weren't his.</p><br>Because you've clearly worked so intimately with him that you know EXACTLY what he does and doesn't do, you know exactly who wants to push which wrestler, who created which gimmick, who worked on which segment and who has decided upon angles and events that, regardless of your or my opinion (and my opinion is that much of them have been crap), have made him quite a bit of money. 'Mania 26 may have been down on 25 but PG or not it made McMahon millions.<p>If you have not worked directly with an individual and obtain all of your information from websites that are not known for their accuracy you haven't got the first clue what they do or don't do. You don't have a clue if or how McMahon works but his pocket book speaks to the contrary anyway.</p><p>Vince is past his prime. His brain is finished. He has nothing more to contribute. And even though his company has kept up with the times, it was because he rode the work of others. By himself, he is pure shit!</p><br>Again, you've clearly worked so closely with him. This is the EXACT reason stars like John Cena, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Taker, Chris Jericho, Mick Foley, Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart (someone who despised McMahon up until recently) all credit McMahon for guiding them, helping them, developing them and making them into stars. He helped forge ALL of those men into megastars, despite the differences and disagreements all of those men have with him they still regard him as a genius and a good businessman; they've worked with him. You haven't.<p>I will apologize for the sarcastic tone of this post but to insinuate Vince is resting on his laurels and has done nothing since the 80's when his company has put on events like Wrestlemania 17, dominated the wrestling market, put WCW out of business and continues to make millions and millions every single year is ridiculous. Your claims of Vince not being involved are also ludicrous, how do you know? A lot of Vince's employees disagree with you.</p><p>Vince has survived the test of time, something he couldn't possibly do by merely copying others while others innovated. Vince McMahon is the reason you're able to watch Pro-Wrestling because it's arguable wrestling would not be half as popular globally if it weren't for him. There's a reason he has created numerous megastars that are household names while TNA, a company currently employing an individual you claim Vince ripped off, has created the some total of none. AJ Styles is not and never will be a household name. Vince is a great business man and, indeed, a genius. Albeit, a flawed genius like the rest of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmien6fCrr%2BNsKmeq6Shsru7zZ5lnKedZMGpvsSam6xnmah6t7XNnJxmpZOirqm7zWapnpmcocZuwMeeZKCdnp7CtHnWnmStoJmjuG60xGagrGZhZoZ4gJRo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kanye-west-the-vampire-leaked-vogue-photo-sparks-memes-2014253.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kanye West, Kim Kardashian Leaked Vogue Mirror Photo Sparks Funny Meme">&larr;

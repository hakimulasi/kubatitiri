Sam is one of the wicked older brothers of the siblings. Sam has a close relationship with his sisters Lily and Mabel. He occasionally worries that he is a bad example for his sisters. They got matching tattoos on their hands as well.</p><h2><span id=Childhood>Childhood</span></h2><p>Frederick Smith, Sam’s father, and Kate Cassidy, Sam’s mother, were both stock brokers. In Bishop’s Stortford, where he was born and raised, he attended St. Mary’s Catholic School.</p><p>His singing voice was given by the gods. At the age of eight, he started taking singing lessons in Saffron Walden, Essex, with jazz pianist Joanna Eden. Mabel Smith’s consequently joined a jazz group. He started singing at a young age. He once belonged to both the Bishop’s Stortford Musical Theater Society and the “Cantate Youth Choir.”</p><p>The majority of people are unaware of the fact that Sam’s current notoriety is solely a result of his parent’s love and support for his singing career.</p><p>Sam was singing “My love is your love” by Whitney Houston when he was eight years old, and he was doing it in the backseat of his parent’s car. At the time, his parents were aware of his exceptional talents. His objectives and career received a lot of support from Fred and Kate, who believed in him.</p><p>His mother in particular and both of his parents worked very hard to help him achieve his objective. In 2009, Kate was charged with using all of her resources and working hours to support her son’s musical career. For the benefit of her child, she was giving up everything.</p><p>She helped her kid make connections with record producers. Both his mother and father were incredibly supportive of all he did. Sam recorded his music at Kilburn, which his father took him to every day. His entire effort led to a Grammy nomination for him.</p><p>He was nominated for six Grammy Awards and won four of them. He thanked his parents and sisters Lily and Mabel as soon as he won the award. While holding the Grammy award, he told his family that he had succeeded.

Despite being quite reserved at the first meeting, the couple faced some awkwardness but eventually started dating.</p><p>In the ’80s, it was not common to see a fair blonde dating a black guy; as a result, it raised a lot of eyebrows. When the couple got married, Charles was a Philadelphia basketball team member.</p><p>The marriage did get some hype at the time due to interracial marriage.<br>According to Charles, he loved his wife very much, and society’s judgments and strange stares did not affect his love for her.

The marriage created public controversy at the time in the late 80s, and the couple had to go through plenty of trouble.</p><p>Blumhardt and Barkley were not even confident enough to talk to each other when they first met because of their racial differences.

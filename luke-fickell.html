Fickell was named AAC Coach of the Year for the 2018 season, which was only the third 11-win season in UC history. He led the team to another 11-win season in 2019. The Bearcats reeled off nine straight wins after falling to Ohio State in the second game of the year. The team won the east division championship in the AAC for the first time, but fell two straight weeks to Memphis, in the final regular season game and in the conference championship. For the second straight year, Cincinnati won its bowl game over an Atlantic Coast Conference team, winning the Birmingham Bowl over Boston College.</p><p>On December 10, 2016, Fickell was named as the 39th head coach of the University of Cincinnati, taking the place of the resigning <a href=#>Tommy Tuberville</a>. In his first season, Fickell led the Bearcats to a 4-8 record.</p><p>After Ohio State posted a 6–6 regular season record, Fickell was passed up for the permanent head job, and instead Ohio State hired Urban Meyer. Fickell guided the Buckeyes one last time in the 2012 Gator Bowl against Meyer's old team, the Florida Gators. After Meyer took the helm, Fickell returned to his old job as co-defensive coordinator, a job in which he served until he was named head coach at Cincinnati.</p><p>In 2011, Fickell was originally named to serve as interim head coach in place of <a href=#>Jim Tressel</a>, who was given a five-game suspension by the NCAA due to a recruiting scandal. However, in May of that year, Tressell resigned and Fickell was given a one-year contract to serve as interim coach, only for the 2011 season.</p><p>After two seasons with the Zips, he returned to Ohio State in 2002 as the special teams coordinator under second-year head coach, <a href=#>Jim Tressel</a>. In 2004, Fickell took over as the linebackers coach, adding the title co-defensive coordinator to his responsibilities in 2005. In 2010, he was named Assistant Coach of the Year by the AFCA, joining a list of Buckeyes coaches to be recognized by the association that also includes Carroll Widdoes, <a href=#>Woody Hayes</a>, <a href=#>Earle Bruce</a>, and <a href=#>Jim Tressel</a>.</p><p>Luke Fickell and his wife, Amy (Goecke), who has a physical therapy degree from Ohio State, have six children -- five sons and one daughter -- including two sets of twin boys. They started dating when Amy was a sophomore at Ohio State; they were married in 2000.</p><p>After a brief stint in the NFL and at Ohio State as a graduate assistant in 1999, in 2000 Fickell was hired by the University of Akron as the defensive line coach.</p><p>Fickell started his playing career at DeSales High School, where he was a two-time first team All-Ohio defensive tackle as well as a three-time state champion in wrestling. After redshirting for the Buckeyes in 1992, Fickell was a standout defensive player, making a school-record 50 consecutive starts at the nose guard position from 1993 to 1996. In his freshman year, he lined up next to <a href=#>Dan Wilkinson</a>. Despite having a torn pectoral muscle, Fickell started the 1997 Rose Bowl, making two tackles in the Buckeyes victory over Arizona State. After graduating from Ohio State in 1997, Fickell signed as an undrafted free agent with the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL). After tearing the ACL in his knee, he spent the remainder of the season on the injured reserve list and was later released by the team.</p><p>Lucas Joseph Fickell (born August 18, 1973) is an American football coach and former player. He is currently the head coach at the University of Cincinnati. He spent most of his career at Ohio State University, first as a player and then as an assistant coach. He was interim head coach at OSU for the entire 2011 season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfocKssYyfoJyjlaG5</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nick-cannon-and-mariah-carey-celebrate-their-twins-12th-birthday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NICK CANNON AND MARIAH CAREY CELEBRATE THEIR TWINS 12TH BIRTHDAY">&larr;
